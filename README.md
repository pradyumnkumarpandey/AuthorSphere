####🚀 Excited to Share My Latest FastAPI Project! 🚀

I've recently built a FastAPI application that combines the power of Python with the flexibility of SQLAlchemy. This project is a robust implementation for managing authors and their books with the following features:

####✨ Key Features:
1️⃣ Author Management: Add, view, and list authors with attributes like name and pen name.
2️⃣ Book Management: Create, retrieve, and paginate books with details like title, category, price, and author association.
3️⃣ Data Validation: Built-in checks for valid inputs like numeric prices and existing authors.
4️⃣ Detailed Relationships: Explore the one-to-many relationship between authors and their books.
5️⃣ Pagination: Efficiently handle large datasets with paginated API responses.

####📦 Tech Stack:

FastAPI for fast, scalable web APIs.
SQLAlchemy for seamless database interaction.
MySQL for data persistence.
Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
🔍 Check out the code snippet below to see how I implemented:

Database models with relationships.
Dependency injection for database sessions.
Response models for consistent API output.
🎯 Why I Loved Building This:
Working on this project deepened my understanding of relational databases, ORM techniques, and building scalable, production-ready APIs. It's a small step toward mastering backend development.

####💡 Next Steps:
I’m exploring ways to enhance this project by adding authentication, advanced search functionality, and deployment to the cloud.

Would love to hear your feedback, ideas, or similar experiences! 🌟
